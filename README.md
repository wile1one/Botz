Repository for the BOTZ raspberry Pi


This is the image of the raspberry Pi controlling project BOTZ...   

issues to fix...    response time from remote devices to bot activity is not the best...

making the round trip more efficient will be one solution...   

This code is the earlier distro of the raspberry pi as it includes the drivers for the USB stuff that we are interfacing..

Chris has built this and it works...   but it is very rough and needs a good tidy up...

You are welcome to download all code on this distro...   it is hoped that you will build your own botz project...

Our WIKI for the project is at  http://gctechspace.org/doku.php?id=botz      

Contributions to this code are invited...
